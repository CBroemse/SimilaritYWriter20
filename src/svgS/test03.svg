a glimpse at one underlaying geometry to write this 2_3_5_Writer

                                 a AND a Or a   > 1 in svg
                                 
                                 think about special signs 'ยง' 
                                 number N :: type (N (i-1))  /=  type(N i)
                                     e.g
                                     type of Double 1.0 is different then
                                     type of Doubel 2.0
                                 the svg in haskell demands the right order
                                 of types on order to buid a function a
                                 the 2_3_5 display
                                 
                                 use fun section to emulate constants of nature
                                 see programming language ample ?!



Imagine types that change their type when they are coveored by another type.
Simply think of the 3x3 representation of the 2_3_5_counter.
I think I have gotten minimal insigths into the often dared limes function 
limes: (lim ...cruel)
lets build a function that does what the idea of our understanding of a limiting 
function is. However this is not a rule but just one exampe of how to build
a function of an limes . To not confuse the neatly defined limes we will
call this function
