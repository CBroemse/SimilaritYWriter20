##### Step IV

Now we try to define rules concerning the metric' above. One guidline is
to use bone list as a mode but keep 'realy big' input like below at bay:

      e.g*> listBackofHead = map show [1..1978419655660313589123979]
         *> lineTerror= map show [[1..1978419655660313589123979]]
      
 above is a relation between 19 and the floating numbers ?!. The number above is 19^19.
 If we would define prime number groups until 19 ( 19 is special with prime numbers:)  
 , the beginnig three digits of one fictive prime number group sorting system until
 19, would be 2 3 5 making 1 step on the sieve below..
         
  Is there a way to 'leapfrog' the shortest path whithout reading every atom of bonelist? 
  
  #### concept to build rules for the case
  
![alt tag](https://github.com/CBroemse/SimilaritYWriter20/blob/master/source/2_3_5_1.png)

      aSieve :: Num b => Int -> [(String, b)]
      
      aSieve2 :: (Num a, Num b) => Int -> [(a, b)]

#### So what is it

    To me the thing above is a metric a 'trivial machiene' sort of speak yet it looks funky.
    The intend was to symbolize the computation that all numbers on the Haskell side became 
    their own computation. It is tempting to assemble whole programs that way, maybe its 
    like an old assembler language but that I need to ask more experienced peers. 
    However it aint a 'walk in the park' and the number of posssibities is staggering.
    Now the Haskell type declaration system with its syntax seems much more appealing. I believe the solution if I ought to   
    understand it must be in the Haskell types with simYvalues first and secondarily to apply this metric
    to compare the different domains found and vsiualize their effects. So back to 'kArmTrack5'
    map ancestory
    
    This last step is more for visiualization
